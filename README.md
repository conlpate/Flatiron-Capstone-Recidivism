### Quick facts:
- The United States spends more than $80 billion annually to keep [roughly 2.3 million people behind bars.](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/12/17/the-hidden-cost-of-incarceration)
- Nearly 47% of people released from prison in 2005 were [re-arrested within 3 yeaars.](https://bjs.ojp.gov/content/pub/pdf/18upr9yfup0514.pdf)
- 450,000 are incarcerated "for nonviolent drug offenses on [any given day."](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html)
- Those in prison who suffer from violence, an estimated 21% of men, often suffer from severe [trauma upon released.](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/blog/2017/06/22/mental_health/)

## Project Overview

As the United States often is reported as having the highest incarceration rate in the world, I felt it prudent to take a look at: prison population growth and recidivism. Taking a cursory look at the statistics and sources above, it became apparent that incarceration is much more about being incarcerated. More often than not, incarceration involves an unknown amount of hidden variables, debilitating for those imprisoned and those funding it. 

With that in mind, I've analyzed prison population growth across four different states (Iowa, Pennsylvania, Louisiana, and Massachusetts), each representing different incarceration rates, and built a classification model to analyze recidivism in Iowa.
