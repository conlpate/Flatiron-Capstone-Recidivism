Using the state as the unit of analysis is sufficient for understanding the broad contours of incarceration in the United States, but it does not provide the level of detail necessary to unpack its causes and consequences.\"\n",

    "- Despite iteratively test multiple classification models, it's become apparent, across multiple metrics, there is not enough data to classify recidivism with our current data. \n",

    "- As we want to identify as many recidivists as possible, broadly, our models were anchored around recall. However, other metrics were considered in model selection and tuning. Specifically, precision and AUC score. \n",
